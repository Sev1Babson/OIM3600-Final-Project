# Final Project Proposal
For our Final Project in this class we want to to develop a dynamic web application that allows users to predict the scores of soccer matches and calculates the accuracy of their predictions based on live match data. One unique Feature we hope to add is allowing for more players to make a prediction, and at the end will allow for user to input the actual results of the game, and the website will calculate the accuracy of you and your fellow players predictions to determine a winner.
