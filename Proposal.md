# Final Project Proposal
For our Final Project in this class we want to to develop a dynamic web application that allows users to predict the scores of soccer matches and calculates the accuracy of their predictions based on live match data. One unique Feature we hope to add is displaying past results from the two teams on the page you make your predictions. This may be a tool used by friend groups to keep track of accuracy and potentially play friendly bets amongst each other.
